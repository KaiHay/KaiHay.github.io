	<body> In this project, I used Three.js to create a cube with text on the front face. The cube has a cylinder attached to it with another cylinder ontop of that one. The whole object rotates and the top most cylinder spins while connected to the object. There is one sphere detached from the object to orient the user because it doesn't move or rotate. The main object has text on its front face and is metallic and reflects light from the light sources.<br>

	There are 3 light sources. One rotates around the object, one oscillates back and forth on a single axis, and one stays still.<br>

	You can move the camera around with the cursor as well. Left click and drag to move around and scroll to zoom in and out.To do this I imported Orbitcontrols<br>

	There is also a texture for the background which is a black to white gradient and the box looks different depending on where you look at it from!<br>

	To run go to the dist directory and run "python3 -m http.server 8000" to run the heli box on port 8000.
